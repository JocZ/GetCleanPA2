## Introduction 
In this document I apply the knowledge aquired in the course. Here I try to demostrate the skills 
developed with the data process.

### Data loading
First the data that are distributed in several files need to be put into a data frame. The training files as well as the testing files were marged into a single dataset,with their corresponding headers. 

### Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation 
As asecond task, I selected the variables with the mean and standard deviation reference in their names. To achieve this goal, I used the regular expresions and subseting tools

### Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
In order to have a full dataset the labels were merged with the train and test data. The resources used in this task were mainly the binding tools


### Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names 

The column names were assigned to the dataset in order to have appropiate labels that descrives the variable
### Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of 
###        each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The subjects data were retrived and then added to the data. Then the data resoulted were saved as a text file
